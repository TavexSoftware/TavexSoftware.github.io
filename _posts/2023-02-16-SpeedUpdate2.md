## Game broke
I mean most stuff still works but only because nothing's been done.

<br>Hello It's Me Max Again. Speed isn't going so well.

## Why nothing happening
Dylan and I have been taking a break for Christmas and holidays so not much has been happening. I have also been suffering from a bit of burnout which obviously Isn't good when you're developing a game.
Progress is still slowly being made, however. Slowly that is.

## Nothing working
I sent the game to one of my friends recently who somehow managed to break the game more times than we have developing it in the span of 10 or so minutes. So sandbox doesn't work. As some of you might know I have been working on developing our steam multiplayer sytem which is of course vital to our game. That's not working either.

<br>To conclude this section: Things broke. Don't know why. It doesn't even matter how hard we try. Keep that in mind because we might have to delay the launch of speed from "No Fucking clue" to "No Fucking Clue + 1"

## So what's going to happen
Not to sure. Dylan seems incredibly keen on doing a game jam in Mid.
<small>*Gdot</small> So we might end up doing that in between hard out periods of development.
We are probably going to be scrapping a lot of what we have done so far. **Big D** has decided to scrap most of my scripts and also changing the art style (Which doesn't really matter considering our art style before was pretty much "Free unity assets").
We are changing the art style now to a style Dylan calls "Ultrakill vibe graphics" and what I call "Lazy shitty graphics". However with all that said I think it does fit the idea of our game.

## Game jam
Me and Dylan might end up doing our own game jam meaning we are competing only against ourselves and releasing the game to Itch.io or somewhere else. For now **Watch this space**.

## That's all for now
Thanks for reading and I'll see You all in a decade when I finaly update this website.

<br>**Goodbye**
